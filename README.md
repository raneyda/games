## Games ##

**Games** is a group of small games created as I am learning python.  Each group
grows in complexity.  In addition I plan to update this as I learn more.  

### Games directories ###

- coin
- dice
- cards

### Module directories ###

I have modified several games from a single file to use a module 'games'.
This module provides access to functions to build games of different types.

games is a module directory under games

- games/coin.py
- games/dice.py
- games/core.py

Core provides game functions that span different game types.
Coin provides game functions for coin games.
Dice provides game functions and classes for dice games.

### Completed ###

- coin
  * coinflip.py
  * coin_frequency.py
- dice
  * dice.py
  * ceelo.py
- cards
  * tbd

### Next Steps ###

- Add proper docstrings [In Progress]
- Move common functions into a module (games) [In Progress]
- Complete additional games
  * cards/trash.py
  * dice/street_craps.py
